# CS230-Final
The Gaming Room is the client and they wanted to extend their game to other mobile platforms.

This document helped me keep a focus on the task at hand and stay on track.

I probably struggled the most with the recommendations section because putting it on paper seemed harder then just saying it.

Bascially taking the functional game and split it up which in trn saved time.  The user is the most important person when it comes to a program
because they run it and control if its liked or disliked.

I tried to keep the document clear and easy to understand which will help with any future updates if needed.
